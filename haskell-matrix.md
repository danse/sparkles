Found through [this Reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/37uqqk/ihaskell_online_help_choose_demo_code_snippets/), there is a video about its use [here](https://youtu.be/2-JFkv9-JOQ?t=14m32s).

It seems very promising, but it requires a lot of Haskell extensions, it is still not on Hackage, i had troubles runnig the demos and trying it on a CSV
